# React + Vite Project

This project is a plain JavaScript (JSX) version of a React application using Vite as the build tool. It was converted from a TypeScript setup to simplify the development process.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Run the Development Server**: Use `npm run dev` to start the Vite development server. This will allow you to view the application in your browser.

3. **Build for Production**: To create a production build, run `npm run build`.

## Notes

- The project has been simplified by removing TypeScript syntax and related configurations.
- Ensure that all components are properly tested after conversion to maintain functionality.
- For any additional features or changes, feel free to modify the existing components or add new ones as needed.
